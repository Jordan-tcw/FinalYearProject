# Final Year Project
## Using multiple machine learning approaches to measure the impact different Airbnb features (property specifications, owner information, and customer reviews) have on the listings.

The fast-expanding and high adoption of the “sharing economy” challenges not only the business of hotel industry but also the theories and models based on the conventional hotel industry. A key area that the hospitality industry competes on is pricing. The aim of this study is to identify the price determinants of sharing economy-based accommodation offers in the digital marketplace. Specifically, a sample of 6,965 accommodation rental offers in the city of Dublin, Ireland listed on Airbnb.com are investigated using regression and classification approaches. Forty-eight explanatory variables in three different categories (property characteristics, host attributes, and online review ratings) are explored for the detrection of the relationships between pricing and its determinants. Sentiment Analysis is explored to determine the relationship between reviews and property review ratings. The strongest regression model was XGBoost model which achieved an original R2 score of 62.2%, and when tuned the model could predict the price of a property within $42 (RMSE of 0.42). Using classification techniques, a gradient boosted model combined with oversampling and extensive hyper parameter tuning procedures was built, that could correctly classify properties into two categories with an 89.9% accuracy. Finally, the top three determinants detected for predicting price were accommodates, room_type entire_home/apt, bedrooms.
